** Dialog Methods for Improved Alphanumeric String Capture
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: peters2011dialog
:YEAR:     2011
:AUTHOR:   Peters, Doug and Stubley, Peter
:END:

Presents a way for dialog level collection of alpha numeric strings via an ASR.
Two main ideas:

1. Skip listing over n-best hypothesis across turns (attempts)
2. Chunking and confirming pieces one by one

** Self-supervised dialogue learning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wu2019self

:END:

The self-supervision signal here is coming from a model which tries to predict
whether a provided tuple of turns is in order or not. Connecting this as the
discriminator in generative-discriminative dialog systems they find better
results.

** Learning from Dialogue after Deployment: Feed Yourself, Chatbot!
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hancock2019learning
:YEAR:     2019
:AUTHOR:   Hancock, Braden and Bordes, Antoine and Mazare, Pierre-Emmanuel and Weston, Jason
:END:

This is an approach to collect supervision signal from deployment data. There
are three tasks for the system (which is a chat bot doing ranking on candidate
responses):

1. Dialogue. The main task. Given the turns till now, the bot ranks which
   response to utter.
2. Satisfaction. Given turns till now, last being user utterance, predict
   whether the user is satisfied.
3. Feedback. After asking for feedback from the user, predict user's response
   (feedback) based on the turns till now.

The models have shared weights, mostly among task 1 and 3.

** Modeling Sequences with Quantum States: A Look Under the Hood
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: bradley2019modeling
:YEAR:     2019
:AUTHOR:   Bradley, Tai-Danae and Stoudenmire, E Miles and Terilla, John
:END:

This paper explores a new direction in language modelling. The idea is still to
learn the underlying distribution of sequences of characters, but here they do
it by learning the quantum analogue of the classical probability distribution
function. Unlike the classical case, marginal distributions there carry enough
information to re-construct the joint distribution. This is the central idea of
the paper, and is explained in the first half. The second half of the paper
explains the theory and implementation of the training algorithm, with a simple
example. Future work would be to apply this algorithm to a more complicated
example, and even adapt it to variable length sequences.

** Deep voice 2: Multi-speaker neural text-to-speech
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: gibiansky2017deep
:YEAR:     2017
:AUTHOR:   Gibiansky, Andrew and Arik, Sercan and Diamos, Gregory and Miller, John and Peng, Kainan and Ping, Wei and Raiman, Jonathan and Zhou, Yanqi
:END:

This paper suggests improvements to [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07825][DeepVoice]] and [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135][Tacotron]], and also proposes a
way to add trainable speaker embeddings. The speaker embeddings are initialized
randomly and trained jointly through backpropagation. The paper lists some
patterns that lead to better performance

1. Transforming speaker embeddings to appropriate dimension and form for every
   place it is added to the model. The transformed speaker embeddings are called
   site-specific speaker embeddings
2. Initializing recurrent layer hidden states with the site-specific speaker
   embeddings.
3. Concatenating the site-specific speaker embedding to input at every timestep
   of the recurrent layer
4. Multiplying layer activations element-wise to the site-specific speaker
   embeddings

** A credit assignment compiler for joint prediction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: chang2016credit
:YEAR:     2016
:AUTHOR:   Chang, Kai-Wei and He, He and Ross, Stephane and Daume III, Hal and Langford, John
:END:

This talks about an API for framing L2S style search problems in style of an
imperative program which allows for two optimizations:

1. memoization
2. forced path collapse, getting losses without going to the last state

Main reduction that happens here is to a cost-sensitive classification problem.

* 17 January, 2020
** Learning language from a large (unannotated) corpus
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: vepstas2014learning
:YEAR:     2014
:AUTHOR:   Vepstas, Linas and Goertzel, Ben
:END:

Introductory paper on the general approach used in [[https://github.com/opencog/learn][learn]]. The idea is to learn
various generalizable syntactic and semantic relations from unannotated corpus.
The relations are expressed using graphs sitting on top of link grammar and
meaning text theory (MTT). While the general approach is sketched out decently
enough, there are details to filled in various steps and experiments to run (as
of the writing in 2014).

On another note, the document is a nice read because of the many interesting
ways of looking at various ideas in understanding languages and going from
syntax to reasoning via semantics.

* 10 January, 2020
** Parsing English with a link grammar
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sleator1995parsing
:YEAR:     1995
:AUTHOR:   Sleator, Daniel DK and Temperley, Davy
:END:

We came to here via opencog's [[https://github.com/opencog/learn][learn]] project. This is a nice perspective setup
also if you are missing out on formal introduction of grammars and all. Overall
a link grammar defines connectors on left and right side of a word with
disjunctions and conjunctions incorporated which then /link/ together to form a
sentence, under certain constraints.

This specific paper shows the formulation and creates a parser for English,
covering many (not all) linguistics phenomena.

* 20 December, 2019
** Generalized end-to-end loss for speaker verification
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wan2018generalized
:YEAR:     2018
:AUTHOR:   Wan, Li and Wang, Quan and Papir, Alan and Moreno, Ignacio Lopez
:END:

This paper is development over their previous research work, Tuple-based end to
end(TE2E) loss, for speaker identification. They try to generalize the concept
of the cosine similarity being used in TE2E by creating similarity matrics for
utterances by a user. They have suggested two losses in the paper:

1) Softmax loss
2) Contrast loss

Both these loss functions had two components, one which brings utterances by a
user together and others, which separates the utterances of different users. Out
of the two, Contrast loss is more rigorous.

** Towards end-to-end spoken language understanding
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: serdyuk2018towards
:YEAR:     2018
:AUTHOR:   Serdyuk, Dmitriy and Wang, Yongqiang and Fuegen, Christian and Kumar, Anuj and Liu, Baiyang and Bengio, Yoshua
:END:

This paper talks about developing an end to end model for intent recognition
form speech. Currently, all the models have several components like ASR and NLU,
which each have some errors of their own degrading the quality of the speech to
intent pipeline. Experiments for two tasks, speech to domain and speech to
intent were performed using the model. The model's architecture is mostly
inspired from end to end speech synthesis models. A unique feature of the
architecture is that they perform sub-sampling after the first GRU layer to
reduce the size of the vector and to tackle the problem of vanishing gradient.

** Your Classifier is Secretly an Energy Based Model and You Should Treat it Like One
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: grathwohl2019classifier
:YEAR:     2019
:AUTHOR:   Will Grathwohl and Kuan-Chieh Wang and Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen and David Duvenaud and Mohammad Norouzi and Kevin Swersky
:END:

They take a regular classifier, pick out logits before softmax and try to
formulate an energy based model able to give $P(x, y)$ and $P(x)$. The
formulation itself is pretty simple with the energy function being $E(x) =
−LogSumExp_yf_\Theta(x)[y]$. Final loss sums cross entropy (for discriminative part)
and negative log likelhood of $P(x)$ approximated using SGLD. Check out the repo
[[https://github.com/wgrathwohl/JEM][here]].

Although the learning mechanism is a little fragile and needs work to be
generally stable, the results are neat.

* 29 November, 2019
** Overton: A Data System for Monitoring and Improving Machine-Learned Products
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: re2019overton
:YEAR:     2019
:AUTHOR:   Ré, Christopher and Niu, Feng and Gudipati, Pallavi and Srisuwananukorn, Charles
:END:

This is more about managing supervision than model. There are 3 problems that
they are trying to solve:
1. Fine grained quality monitoring,
2. Support for multi-component pipelines, and
3. Updating supervision

For this, they make easy to use abstractions for describing supervision and
developing models. They also do a lot of multitask learning and snorkelish weak
supervision, including the recent slicing abstractions for fine grained quality
control.

While you have to adapt a few pieces for your own case (and scale), Overton is a
nice testimony for success of things like weak supervision and higher level
development abstractions in production.

** Slice-based learning: A programming model for residual learning in critical data slices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: chen2019slice
:YEAR:     2019
:AUTHOR:   Chen, Vincent and Wu, Sen and Ratner, Alexander J and Weng, Jen and Ré, Christopher
:END:

This is taking the snorkel's labelling function idea to group data instances in
/slices/, segments which are interesting to us from an overall quality
perspective. These slicing functions are important not only for identifying and
narrowing down to specific kinds of data instances but also for learning slice
specific representations which works out as computationally cheap way (there are
other benefits too) of replicating a Mixture of Experts style model.

Like with labelling functions, we have the slice membership predicted using
heuristics which are noisy. This membership value along with slice
representations (and slice prediction confidences) help create the slice aware
representation to be used for the final task. The appendix has few good examples
of slicing functions.
